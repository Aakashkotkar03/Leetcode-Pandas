Table: Users

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| user_id        | int     |
| name           | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
user_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the ID and the name of the user. The name consists of only lowercase and uppercase characters.
 

Write a solution to fix the names so that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase.

Return the result table ordered by user_id.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Users table:
+---------+-------+
| user_id | name  |
+---------+-------+
| 1       | aLice |
| 2       | bOB   |
+---------+-------+
Output: 
+---------+-------+
| user_id | name  |
+---------+-------+
| 1       | Alice |
| 2       | Bob   |
+---------+-------+


Fixing User Names to Have Proper Capitalization
Introduction
In this code snippet, we have a function called fix_names that takes a Pandas DataFrame containing user information as input. The function aims to correct the capitalization of user names so that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase. It then returns the updated DataFrame sorted by the user_id column.

Key Concepts
Pandas DataFrame: Pandas is a popular Python library for data manipulation and analysis. DataFrames are two-dimensional, size-mutable, and potentially heterogeneous tabular data structures with labeled axes.
String Capitalization: The str.capitalize() method in Python capitalizes the first character of a string and converts the rest of the characters to lowercase.
Code Structure
The fix_names function takes a Pandas DataFrame named users as input. It modifies the 'name' column of the DataFrame by applying the str.capitalize() method to each name. Finally, it sorts the DataFrame based on the 'user_id' column in ascending order and returns the updated DataFrame.

Conclusion
The provided Python function efficiently corrects the capitalization of user names in a Pandas DataFrame. By utilizing the str.capitalize() method and sorting the DataFrame based on the 'user_id' column, the function ensures that the names are formatted correctly and the DataFrame is ordered appropriately. This solution adheres to the requirements specified and provides a clean and effective way to fix the capitalization of user names.
