+-------------+---------+
name is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table gives information about the name of a country, the continent to which it belongs, its area, the population, and its GDP value.
 

A country is big if:

it has an area of at least three million (i.e., 3000000 km2), or
it has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., 25000000).
Write a solution to find the name, population, and area of the big countries.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Solution: Finding Big Countries
Introduction
In this article, we will discuss a solution to find the name, population, and area of big countries. A country is considered big if it has an area of at least three million square kilometers or a population of at least twenty-five million people.

Key Concepts
To solve this problem, we will use the pandas library in Python. Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library that provides data structures and functions to efficiently handle structured data.

Code Structure
The code provided consists of a function called big_countries that takes a pandas DataFrame called world as input and returns a DataFrame containing the name, population, and area of the big countries.

Code Examples
Let's take a closer look at the code and understand how it works.
The big_countries function takes a DataFrame called world as input. It uses the loc function of pandas to filter the rows of the DataFrame based on the given conditions. The conditions are defined using logical operators (>=) to check if the area is greater than or equal to three million or if the population is greater than or equal to twenty-five million.

The filtered rows are then selected using the column names 'name', 'population', and 'area'. The resulting DataFrame is stored in the output variable and returned as the final result.

Conclusion
In this article, we have discussed a solution to find the name, population, and area of big countries. We have used the pandas library in Python to efficiently filter the rows of a DataFrame based on specific conditions. By using the provided code, you can easily find the big countries based on their area and population.
