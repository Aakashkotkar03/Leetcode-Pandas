# Problem
Table: Tweets

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| tweet_id       | int     |
| content        | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
tweet_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains all the tweets in a social media app.
 

Write a solution to find the IDs of the invalid tweets. The tweet is invalid if the number of characters used in the content of the tweet is strictly greater than 15.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Tweets table:
+----------+----------------------------------+
| tweet_id | content                          |
+----------+----------------------------------+
| 1        | Vote for Biden                   |
| 2        | Let us make America great again! |
+----------+----------------------------------+
Output: 
+----------+
| tweet_id |
+----------+
| 2        |
+----------+
Explanation: 
Tweet 1 has length = 14. It is a valid tweet.
Tweet 2 has length = 32. It is an invalid tweet.


Finding Invalid Tweets in a Social Media App
Introduction
In a social media app, it is important to ensure the quality and validity of the content being posted. One way to do this is by identifying and flagging invalid tweets. An invalid tweet can be defined as a tweet that exceeds a certain character limit. In this article, we will discuss how to find the IDs of invalid tweets using Python.

Key Concepts
Before we dive into the code, let's understand some key concepts:

Pandas: Pandas is a popular Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions to efficiently handle structured data, such as tables.

DataFrames: A DataFrame is a two-dimensional table-like data structure in Pandas. It consists of rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet or a SQL table.

Primary Key: A primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It ensures the integrity and uniqueness of the data.

Code Structure
The code provided is a Python function called invalid_tweets. It takes a Pandas DataFrame named tweets as input and returns another DataFrame containing the IDs of the invalid tweets.

Conclusion
Identifying and flagging invalid tweets is an important task in a social media app. By using the invalid_tweets function provided in this article, you can easily find the IDs of the invalid tweets based on a character limit. This can help maintain the quality and validity of the content being posted on the platform.
