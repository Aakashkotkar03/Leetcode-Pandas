DataFrame students
+-------------+--------+
| Column Name | Type   |
+-------------+--------+
| id          | int    |
| first       | object |
| last        | object |
| age         | int    |
+-------------+--------+
Write a solution to rename the columns as follows:

id to student_id
first to first_name
last to last_name
age to age_in_years
The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:
Input:
+----+---------+----------+-----+
| id | first   | last     | age |
+----+---------+----------+-----+
| 1  | Mason   | King     | 6   |
| 2  | Ava     | Wright   | 7   |
| 3  | Taylor  | Hall     | 16  |
| 4  | Georgia | Thompson | 18  |
| 5  | Thomas  | Moore    | 10  |
+----+---------+----------+-----+
Output:
+------------+------------+-----------+--------------+
| student_id | first_name | last_name | age_in_years |
+------------+------------+-----------+--------------+
| 1          | Mason      | King      | 6            |
| 2          | Ava        | Wright    | 7            |
| 3          | Taylor     | Hall      | 16           |
| 4          | Georgia    | Thompson  | 18           |
| 5          | Thomas     | Moore     | 10           |
+------------+------------+-----------+--------------+
Explanation: 
The column names are changed accordingly.

First, we import pandas as pd.

We create a sample DataFrame named students with columns 'id', 'first', 'last', and 'age'.

We use the rename() method on the DataFrame students and pass a dictionary where keys are the old column names and values are the new column names we want. In this case, we map 'id' to 'student_id', 'first' to 'first_name', 'last' to 'last_name', and 'age' to 'age_in_years'.

We assign the result back to the students DataFrame.

Finally, we print the modified DataFrame to see the result with the renamed columns.
